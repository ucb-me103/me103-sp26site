Teaching Assistant

Hello! I'm Steph, a 5th year MS Mech E concentrating on Assistive Medical Technology. I was on the Cal Women's Swim team during undergrad (Go Bears!) so I love to chat about balancing the stress of life, jobs, and extracurriculars with being a Mech E. On the academic side, I love lagrangian robotics, physics and microcontrollers. When I'm not in Hesse, I am a professional DJ in SF, and love to rock climb. Come to OH to chat about anything!
