Teaching Assistant

Hi! I’m Larry and I’m a fourth year ME major from Toronto. I love optimal controls, difussion based learning, and robotics, but my research is currently in PINNs and MGNs. In my free time, I like to try new restaurants and travel. I am also a private pilot working on my instrument rating!
