Teaching Assistant

Hi! I’m Larry and I’m a 4th year ME major (although I wish I was EECS) from Toronto, Canada. I love optimal controls, diffusion based learning, and robotics, but my research is currently in physics-informed neural networks and mesh-graph networks for fluid-solid interaction with Professor Gu's Research Group. 

In my free time, I like to try new restaurants, cook, play music, and travel. I am also a private pilot working on my instrument rating!
