Haiii! I’m Dalil!

I’m a 4th year MechE and BioE double major! I’m very focused in Computational Mechanics for solids - I work in the Kamrin Group on computational modeling methods for the contact evolution and deformation of elastoplastic particles to simulate power compaction.

Outside of these fun academic pursuits, I love music and concerts and raving and also skateboarding and powerlifting! Some of my favorite artists to listen right now are Jane Remover, Ninajirachi, 2hollis, The Hellp, and Bladee!

Always happy to get some new music recs, so do share if you see me around!
