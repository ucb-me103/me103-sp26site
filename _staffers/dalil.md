Haiii! I’m Dalil!

I’m a 4th year MechE and BioE double major! I work in the Kamrin Group on computational modeling methods for the contact evolution and deformation of elastoplastic particles to simulate power compaction.

Outside academics, I love music, concerts, raving, skateboarding, and powerlifting! Some of my favorite artists right now are Jane Remover, Ninajirachi, 2hollis, The Hellp, and Bladee!

Always happy to get some new music recs, so do share if you see me around!
