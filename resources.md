As mentioned in the policies, the lab report for each lab **must be written in LaTeX**. This is to help prepare for the final lab report in this class, and the other profession reports/writing. Here is a LaTeX report template that can be used, the link will bring you to an Overleaf document: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/ycyyjdnvcmkj#60f101](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ycyyjdnvcmkj#60f101)

Using this template isn't required, this template can just be used as a guide if you want. 

There are two options to make a copy of the template.

1. Download the Project Source. On the top left cover click on Menu. Under "Downloads" you can download the project source. 

2. Copy the Project. On the top left cover click on Menu. Under "Actions" you can copy the project and modify a personal copy.

## Lecture Supplements 

The main reference text for this course is: 

- Mechanical Measurements, Beckwith, Marangoni and Lienhard, 6th ed., Prentice Hall, 2007. [TA165 .B38 2007](https://search.library.berkeley.edu/permalink/01UCS_BER/s4lks2/cdi_jndl_porta_oai_ndlsearch_ndl_go_jp_R100000136_I1130000796998882944)

A scan of the book has been placed on e-reserve by the libraries, and can be accessed [here](https://ucbears.lib.berkeley.edu/991013052839706532_C117996789/view) (up to three concurrent viewers are possible due to copyright considerations). Reading chapter references in the table above are given from the sixth edition, but earlier versions of the text will be perfectly acceptable for understanding the course material. Used copies (at least of earlier editions) can be found for $10 or $12 on, e.g., Bookfinder.com. 

Several other texts may be of interest to those wishing to go into more depth on any of the topics:
- Measurement and Instrumentation: Theory and Application, Morris and Langari. Available online via the library website. A good online alternative that covers much of the content of Beckwith, although without detailed coverage of FFTs.
- Mechanical Measurements, Venkateshan, Available online via the library website. Ditto.
- Gonzalez and Woods (GW) [Digital Image Processing Textbook](https://www.cl72.org/090imagePLib/books/Gonzales,Woods-Digital.Image.Processing.4th.Edition.pdf). This textbook is a great introduction to the world of image processing and digital signal processing. 
- Mechanical Engineers’ Handbook, ed. Kutz, Wiley 2017. Particularly chapters 16-18. Available online via the library website. Concise explanations of measurement variability and statistical modeling of data.
- Statistics for Experimenters, Box, Hunter, and Hunter, Wiley 2005. QA279 .B69 2005. This classic text is by the pioneers of fractional factorial design of experiments.
- Design and Analysis of Experiments, Montgomery, 2020. Available online via the library website. A well-known text covering experimental design and statistical analysis of data.
- The Art of Electronics, Horowitz, Wiley 2015. TK7815 .H67 2015. This is a classic book on digital and analog electronic circuits and could be a valuable reference for designing custom experimental sensors.
- Introduction to Error Analysis, Jack Merrin (self-published), available on Amazon. A concise and crisp overview of how to calculate uncertainty, with clear coverage of significant figures. 
- Analysis of Messy Data, Volumes I, II and III, Milliken and Johnson, Chapman and Hall/CRC. As the name implies, this series goes into great detail into how to deal with ‘messy’ datasets with uneven sizes, outliers, and so on.
